Analysis of steel alloy composition and mechanical properties using Excel
Steel Alloy Composition ,Temparature Range vs Mechanical Properties – Excel Analysis

This project analyses the relationship between temperature, alloy composition, and mechanical properties of steels using Microsoft Excel.

Dataset

Public steel/alloy dataset (~400 samples)

Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (excel formulas, pivot tables, charts, dashboards)

Objective
To study the effect of temperature and alloying elements on yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area, with relevance to steel manufacturing and quality control.

Methodology

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Temperature range classification

Pivot table analysis

Dashboard-based visualisation

Key Observations

Yield stress and ultimate tensile strength decrease with increasing temperature due to thermal softening.

Tensile elongation and reduction of area increase at higher temperatures, indicating improved ductility.
